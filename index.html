            <p>Hello! I am a Neuroscience Ph.D. student at The University of Texas at Austin. In the <a href="https://slhs.utexas.edu/research/hamilton-lab" target="_blank">Hamilton Lab</a>, I study how the brain processes sound, focusing on auditory attention and speech perception in noisy environments. My research uses advanced electrophysiology techniques, including EEG and intracranial EEG (sEEG), to uncover the neural mechanisms of selective auditory attention. By combining game-based training paradigms and real-time neural decoding, I aim to translate findings into practical tools that improve auditory accessibility for individuals in complex listening settings. In another project, I use computational models to study how different brain regions represent acoustic features of speech and music, such as spectrograms and pitch. This work bridges neuroscience, computational modeling, and auditory signal processing to understand how the brain encodes complex auditory inputs.</p>

            <p>Before moving to Austin for my Ph.D. in August 2022, I was a Research Assistant in <a href="https://www.jarvislab.net/" target="_blank">Erich Jarvis' Lab</a> at The Rockefeller University, New York. Here I conducted retrograde and anterograde viral tracing experiments to map out the connectivity between the laryngeal motor cortex and orofacial motor cortex. Both regions are associated with vocal communication in mice.<p>
                
            <p>With over 6 years of experience in neuroscience research, I have worked on diverse projects, such as building encoding models, neural connectivity mapping in vocal communication circuits, investigating executive function task processing in children, and carrying out neuropsychological assessments for individuals with stroke and epilepsy.</p>

            </p>I am also super passionate about UX Research and harnessing research findings to design inclusive technology that improves the way people interact with the world around them. </p>
            
            <p>Promoting diversity and mentorship in STEM is deeply important to me. As a woman in STEM, I am interested in empowering the next generation of scientists through mentorship and professional development opportunities.</p>
            
            <p>I have presented my research at conferences like Advances and Perspectives in Auditory Neuroscience (APAN), Society for Neuroscience (SfN) and received awards like the Texas SLH Foundation Research Award. </p>

            <p>Outside of work, you will find me trying new restaurants and cuisines, reading at a coffee shop, volunteering at the Austin Animal Shelter, or planning my next travel. :) </p>
