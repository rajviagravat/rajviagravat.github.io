        <p>Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in Neuroscience at The University of Texas at Austin, focusing on how the brain processes speech and auditory information and studying auditory attention. In the Hamilton Lab, I study auditory attention and neuroplasticity in epilepsy patients using electrophysiology techniques like electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG (sEEG). Concurrently, for another project, I use speech and music encoding models to understand how different brain areas represent acoustic features of speech and music, such as spectrograms and pitch.</p>
        
        <p>With over 5 years of experience in neuroscience research, I have worked on diverse projects, such as neural connectivity mapping in vocal communication circuits, executive function task processing in children, and cognitive assessments for individuals with stroke and epilepsy.</p>
        
        <p>Promoting diversity and mentorship in STEM is deeply important to me. As a mentor, I guide undergraduates in neuroscience research and professional development. I also serve on the student board for UT's CARE research group.</p>
        
        <p>I have presented my research at conferences like Society for Neuroscience (SfN) and received awards like the Texas SLH Foundation Research Award. Beyond research, I volunteer for causes like animal welfare and children's education. With technical skills, cross-domain experience, and a commitment to mentorship, I am well-equipped to contribute to speech and attention neuroscience.</p>
