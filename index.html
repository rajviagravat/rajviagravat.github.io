        <h1>Rajvi Agravat</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in Neuroscience at The University of Texas at Austin, focusing on how the brain processes speech and auditory information and studying auditory attention. In the Hamilton Lab, I study auditory attention and neuroplasticity in epilepsy patients using electrophysiology techniques like electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG (sEEG). Concurrently, for another project, I use speech and music encoding models to understand how different brain areas represent acoustic features of speech and music, such as spectrograms and pitch. 
            
            With over 5 years of experience in neuroscience research, I have worked on diverse projects, such as neural connectivity mapping in vocal communication circuits, executive function task processing in children, and cognitive assessments for individuals with stroke and epilepsy. 
            
            Promoting diversity and mentorship in STEM is deeply important to me. As a mentor, I guide undergraduates in neuroscience research and professional development. I also serve on the student board for UT's CARE research group. 
            
            I have presented my research at conferences like Society for Neuroscience (SfN) and received awards like the Texas SLH Foundation Research Award. Beyond research, I volunteer for causes like animal welfare and children's education. With technical skills, cross-domain experience, and a commitment to mentorship, I am well-equipped to contribute to speech and attention neuroscience.</p>
